# Code to for 2021 ORC da Vinci Challenge 🤖
Python code expressly written for an EV3 Mindstorm robot competing in the Ottawa Robotics Competition (ORC). This program drew the Taj Mahal and won first at the ORC.

The `main.py` file is run on the [CPU](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/ev3-intelligent-brick-45500), which is running MicroPython.

This repo is supposed to be a reference point if you are unsure how to start programming the EV3 in Python. For more information, please reference [LEGO's website](https://education.lego.com/en-us/product-resources/mindstorms-ev3/teacher-resources/python-for-ev3).

> ‼️ Please note the the whole program is not included in this repo due to competition regulations, but the I have been permitted to include the most technically challenging parts of the code.

## Installation 🔧

> The installation is explained in detail on the [LEGO education site](https://education.lego.com/en-us/product-resources/mindstorms-ev3/teacher-resources/python-for-ev3). 

Once all the required software is installed on the EV3, simply clone the repo and use the code in the `main.py` file.
