# 2021 ORC da Vinci Challenge ðŸ¤–
Python code expressly written for a LEGO EV3 Mindstorm robot competing in the [Ottawa Robotics Competition](http://www.orc.ieeeottawa.ca/en/) (ORC). This program drew the Taj Mahal and [won first place at the ORC](http://www.orc.ieeeottawa.ca/wp-content/uploads/ORC2021-RankingsBIL.pdf).

The `main.py` file is run on the [CPU](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/ev3-intelligent-brick-45500), which is running MicroPython.

> Please note the the whole program is not included in this repo due to competition regulations, but the I have been permitted to include the most technically challenging parts of the code.

## Installation ðŸ”§

The installation is explained in detail on the [LEGO education site](https://education.lego.com/en-us/product-resources/mindstorms-ev3/teacher-resources/python-for-ev3). 

Once all the required software is installed on the EV3, simply clone the repo and use the code in the `main.py` file.
